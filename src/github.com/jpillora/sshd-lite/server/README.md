# sshd-lite

A feature-light Secure Shell Daemon `sshd(8)` written in Go (Golang). A slightly more practical version of the SSH daemon described in this blog post http://blog.gopheracademy.com/go-and-ssh/. **Warning, this is beta software**.

### Install

**Binaries**

See [the latest release](https://github.com/jpillora/sshd-lite/releases/latest)

**Source**

``` sh
$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/sshd-lite
```

### Features

* Cross platform single binary
* No dependencies
* Remote shells
* Authentication (`user:pass` and `authorized_keys`)
* Seed server-key generation

### Usage

```
$ sshd-lite --help
```

<tmpl,code: go run main.go --help>
```

	Usage: sshd-lite [options] <auth>

	Version: 0.0.0

	Options:
	  --host, listening interface (defaults to all)
	  --port -p, listening port (defaults to 22, then fallsback to 2200)
	  --shell, the type of to use shell for remote sessions (defaults to bash)
	  --keyfile, a filepath to an private key (for example, an 'id_rsa' file)
	  --keyseed, a string to use to seed key generation
	  --version, display version
	  -v, verbose logs

	<auth> must be set to one of:
	  1. a username and password string separated by a colon ("user:pass")
	  2. a path to an ssh authorized keys file ("~/.ssh/authorized_keys")
	  3. "none" to disable client authentication :WARNING: very insecure

	Notes:
	  * if no keyfile and no keyseed are set, a random RSA2048 key is used
	  * once authenticated, clients will have access to a shell of the
	  current user. sshd-lite does not lookup system users.
	  * sshd-lite only supports remotes shells. tunnelling and command
	  execution are not currently supported.
